# Hierarchical Order (Foundational → Domain → Reference) - 23 Ontologies
# Order based on ontological dependency hierarchy

# 1. Upper-level foundational ontologies (most general)
bfo-base.owl        # Basic Formal Ontology - top-level categories
ro-base.owl         # Relations Ontology - foundational relations

# 2. Mid-level foundational ontologies 
iao-base.owl        # Information Artifact Ontology - information entities
omo-base.owl        # OBO Metadata Ontology - metadata standards
pato-base.owl       # Phenotype and Trait Ontology - qualities

# 3. Anatomical/structural ontologies
uberon-base.owl     # Uberon - multi-species anatomy
pco-base.owl        # Population and Community Ontology

# 4. Domain-specific base ontologies
obi-base.owl        # Ontology for Biomedical Investigations
fao-base.owl        # Functional Aquatic Ontology
po-base.owl         # Plant Ontology - base version
foodon-base.owl     # Food Ontology - base version

# 5. Large reference ontologies (potential overlaps)
go.owl              # Gene Ontology - huge, many cross-references
chebi.owl           # Chemical Entities of Biological Interest
envo.owl            # Environment Ontology

# 6. Specialized domain ontologies
so.owl              # Sequence Ontology
uo.owl              # Units of Measurement Ontology
taxrank.owl         # Taxonomic Rank Vocabulary

# 7. External vocabularies and databases
eccode.owl          # Enzyme Commission numbers
rhea.owl            # Rhea reaction database
pfam.owl            # Protein families database
interpro.owl        # InterPro protein analysis
gtdb.owl            # Genome Taxonomy Database
ror.owl             # Research Organization Registry

# 8. Metadata and attribution
credit.owl          # CRediT - contributor roles (last, minimal impact)
