# Ontology Order Testing - Findings & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

We successfully created and executed a comprehensive testing framework to investigate how ontology ordering affects ROBOT merge behavior, particularly with the `--annotate-defined-by` flag. 

**Key Finding:** With our current test dataset (6 ontologies), **ordering does not affect merge results**. All three ordering strategies produced identical outputs.

## Test Setup

### Test Environment
- **Branch:** `order_testing` (isolated from main development)
- **Execution:** Docker-based containerized testing
- **Dataset:** Test subset excluding NCBITaxon (6 ontologies: BFO-base, RO-base, IAO-base, PATO-base, ENVO, CRediT)
- **Memory:** Reduced to 16GB for local testing feasibility

### Ordering Strategies Tested

1. **Alphabetical Order** (Current Default)
   - Standard filesystem ordering
   - `bfo-base.owl`, `credit.owl`, `envo.owl`, `iao-base.owl`, `pato-base.owl`, `ro-base.owl`

2. **Hierarchical Order** (Recommended)
   - Foundational → Domain → Reference
   - `bfo-base.owl`, `ro-base.owl`, `iao-base.owl`, `pato-base.owl`, `envo.owl`, `credit.owl`

3. **Size-Based Order** 
   - Largest first (potential memory optimization)
   - `envo.owl` (9.9MB), `pato-base.owl` (3.1MB), `ro-base.owl` (821KB), etc.

## Results

### Merge Statistics
- **Total terms processed:** 10,557 terms
- **Terms with definers:** 3,756 terms
- **Defining ontologies:** 6 ontologies
- **Cross-definitions:** 2,860 terms
- **File sizes:** All merges produced identical 14.0MB files

### Term Attribution Analysis
All ordering strategies resulted in identical term attribution:
```
quality     : 2,803 terms (74.6%)
ENVO        :   897 terms (23.9%)
plant_anatomy:   44 terms (1.2%)
ncbi_taxonomy:    5 terms (0.1%)
plant_structure_development_stage: 4 terms (0.1%)
pato.ontology:    3 terms (0.1%)
```

### Cross-Definition Examples
- PATO terms consistently defined by "quality" namespace
- ENVO terms consistently defined by "ENVO" namespace
- No differences across ordering strategies

## Analysis

### Why Order Didn't Matter

1. **Minimal Overlap:** Our test ontologies have relatively little term overlap
2. **Clear Ownership:** Terms are well-partitioned by namespace/prefix
3. **Base Versions:** Many ontologies are "-base" versions with reduced external dependencies
4. **Small Dataset:** Only 6 ontologies vs. production's 30+ ontologies

### When Order Might Matter

Order becomes important when:
- **Large overlapping ontologies** (e.g., GO + CHEBI both defining chemical terms)
- **Mixed base/full versions** (full versions import terms from base versions)
- **Cross-domain terms** (terms that legitimately belong to multiple ontologies)
- **Import relationships** (complex dependency graphs)

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced merge_ontologies.py
Added `ontology_order` parameter to enable custom ordering:
```python
def merge_ontologies(
    repo_path: str,
    input_dir_name: str = 'ontology_data_owl',
    output_filename: str = 'CDM_merged_ontologies.owl',
    ontology_order: Optional[List[str]] = None  # NEW
) -> bool:
```

### Testing Framework
- **Automated testing:** `test_merge_orders.py`
- **Comparison analysis:** `compare_merges.py` 
- **Annotation analysis:** `analyze_annotations.py`
- **Docker integration:** Works with existing containerized environment

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Keep current alphabetical ordering** - No evidence of problems with test dataset
2. **Preserve testing framework** - Valuable for future testing with larger datasets
3. **Document findings** - Understanding that order may matter with different data

### Future Considerations
1. **Test with production dataset** - Run same tests with full 30+ ontology set
2. **Test with NCBITaxon included** - Large reference ontology may show different behavior
3. **Monitor term attribution** - Watch for terms incorrectly attributed to wrong ontology
4. **Consider hierarchical order for production** - May provide better logical organization

### Production Dataset Testing
To test with full dataset:
```bash
# Switch to production environment
ENV_FILE=.env docker-compose run cdm-ontologies python ontology_order_testing/test_merge_orders.py

# This would require:
# - Updated order configurations with all 30+ ontologies
# - Hierarchical ordering based on ontological dependencies
# - Sufficient memory/time for large merges
```

## Recommended Hierarchical Order (Production)

For future production testing, consider this dependency-based order:

```
# 1. Upper-level foundational
bfo-base.owl
ro-base.owl

# 2. Mid-level foundational  
iao-base.owl
omo-base.owl
pato-base.owl
caro-base.owl

# 3. Domain-specific base versions
uberon-base.owl
cl-base.owl
po-base.owl
fao-base.owl
pco-base.owl
obi-base.owl

# 4. Large reference ontologies (potential conflicts)
ncbitaxon.owl
chebi.owl
go.owl
envo.owl

# 5. Application ontologies
foodon-base.owl
so-base.owl
uo-base.owl
taxrank-base.owl

# 6. External vocabularies
eccode.owl
rhea.owl
interpro.owl
pfam.owl
gtdb.owl
ror.owl
credit.owl

# 7. In-house last
kegg.owl
metacyc.owl
seed.owl
modelseed.owl
```

## Conclusion

While our current test dataset shows no impact from ordering, the testing framework provides valuable infrastructure for:
- **Future validation** with larger datasets
- **Quality assurance** for term attribution
- **Debugging** merge issues
- **Performance optimization** research

The enhanced `merge_ontologies.py` function maintains backward compatibility while enabling custom ordering when needed.

## Repository Status

- **Testing branch:** `order_testing` - Contains all testing infrastructure
- **Main branch:** `dev` - Unchanged, stable production code
- **Integration path:** Testing framework can be merged back if proven valuable
